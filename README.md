# TLS 1.3 protocol implementation in Rust

This is an educational project to learn about the TLS 1.3 protocol and general challenges on implementing binary-level
network protocols.

The project attempts to follow the standard [RFC8466](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446) as closely as
possible in naming conventions and data structures when converting the standard into Rust implementation.

The implementation is not likely the most efficient in terms of performance, or might not apply the best cryptographic
practices.
It leaves cryptographic operations mostly for external libraries, and we just generate some cryptographically random
bits.

In this project, we are more interested in the TLS protocol in byte level and how to implement decoders, create
functional tests for them and integrate fuzzing straight from the beginning.

Most of the data structures and their encoders have been provided. The logic to implement the handshake, error checking
and decoding is left mostly for the student.

## Quickstart for Rust

We do not provide teaching for the language itself, but we can help on many issues.
If you have programmed with any low-level language, you should be able to grasp the basics quickly.

If you fight with the compiler, it is just preventing potential bugs from the runtime instead.
You have to adapt the idea that data is always owned.
Read the chapter in Rust book about [ownership.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html)

This project attempts to avoid some complex features of Rust.
You don't need to know lifetimes to complete the TLS handshake and decrypt application data content. It is okay to make
additional copying on this project
with the cost of performance and increased memory usage.

For general guidance, check

* [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
* You can use ChatGPT, Copilot, or other LLM, for example, to explain some complex lines of code. They are usually very
  accurate.

To get started with Rust environment, use [rustup.](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

It is also important to get your IDE environment properly set up. For a beginner, the most straight-forward ways are:

* Use VSCode with [Rust Analyzer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust).
    * Configure
      VSCode [to run `rustfmt` on save](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67859926/how-to-run-cargo-fmt-on-save-in-vscode).
    * After that, editor should be able to note most problems in the code, and for example, to run single functional
      tests from the IDE.
    * You can also use [Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/clippy/usage.html) to find issues in your code. You
      can also configure VSCode to run it automatically in real-time, but it will take some resources.
    * Additionally, if you want to try, you can also use student license to run GitHub Copilot. But don't adapt code
      pieces you don't understand. It also gives access to
      using [GitHub Copilot Chat with your code](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-chat/about-github-copilot-chat).
      After that, you can even highlight specific code and ask questions or suggestions from the Copilot. But then
      again, do not use things blindly.
* Use student license for [JetBrain's RustRover.](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/)
    * You can apply the same as above also for RustRover

## Type-Length-Value (TLV) pattern

In (binary) network communication
protocols, [type-length-value or tag-length-value (TLV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type%E2%80%93length%E2%80%93value)
is
a common pattern, and TLS follows it in its many sub-protocols.

For example, the lowest layer in TLS protocol uses
so-called [Record protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446#section-5).

It wraps the higher level protocols, by following the idea of TLV.
To see in practice, we can take a look for the TLS Record ASN.1 definition:

```asn

```

## Functional testing (positive and negative)

Implementing functional tests in Rust can be
done [to the same file as implementation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html).

To demonstrate testing, alert protocol is the simplest sub-protocol in TLS.
Take a look for [alert.rs](src/alert.rs) which implements the data structures and encoders and decoders. In the end of
the file, there is test module. If you have configured your IDE correctly, you should be able to click the play â–¶ button
to run the single test function, for example, `test_alert_from_bytes`, or all the tests from the module at once.

You can also do the same from the command line:

```shell
cargo test alert::tests::test_alert_from_bytes
```

Since the alert protocol uses only two bytes, it is straightforward to implement both positive tests and negative tests.
